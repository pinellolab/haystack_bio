    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>This program creates motif-based hidden Markov models
      (HMMs) of families of related biosequences. The program takes as
      input a set of DNA or protein motif models and produces as output a
      single HMM containing the given motifs. The program can produce
      three types of models: linear models, in which the motifs are
      arranged like beads on a string, completely connected models, which
      allow for repetitions of motifs and for motifs to appear in any
      order, and star models. Mhmm writes its output in a
      format readable by the other MEME Suite programs, 
      <a href="mhmms.html">mhmms</a> and <a href="mhmmscan.html">mhmmscan</a>.
      
      <p>Three types of models may be produced. A linear motif-based HMM
      consists of a sequence of motif models, each separated by one or
      more tied insert states that represent the spacer region between
      motifs. A completely connected model, on the other hand, includes
      transitions from the end of each motif to the beginning of every
      other motif in the model (with a spacer model along each
      transition). This more general topology allows for motifs that are
      repeated, deleted or shuffled. A star model is also available. By
      default, the program produces a linear model.</p>

      <p>Transition probabilities among motifs are derived from the motif
      occurence information in the given MEME file. For the completely
      connected topology, this information is derived from all of the
      motif occurences. For the linear topology, the information is
      derived only from the best-scoring sequence. Alternatively, the
      order and spacing of motifs within a linear model may be specified
      via the <span class="popt">--order</span> option.</p>

              distribution would be a bell-shaped curve such as a Gaussian.
              Modeling the length distribution explicitly is computationally
              expensive; however, as a Gaussian distribution can only be
