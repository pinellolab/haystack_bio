    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>mhmmscan searches a sequence database using a motif-based hidden
      Markov model (HMM) of the kind produced by <a href="mhmm.html">mhmm</a>.
      This program is similar to mhmms, except that mhmmscan</p>
      <ul>
        <li>searches arbitrarily long sequences, and</li>
        <li>allows the model to match a given sequence multiple times, and
        each match is reported separately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each sequence-vs-model match is assigned an <i>E</i>-value, and
      matches that score below a user-specified <i>E</i>-value threshold
      are printed in order of increasing <i>E</i>-value.</p>
      <p>mhmmscan has two modes of computing match
      scores:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>p-</i>value score mode.</li>
        <li>log-odds score mode</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In <i>p-</i>value score mode, the search sequence can be
      thought of as consisting of three steps:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>find motif matches ("hits") with each sequence with
      <i>p-</i>values less than the user-specified <em><i>p-</i>value
      threshold</em>,</li>
      <li>coalesce hits found in each sequence into "matches", where hits
      separated by more than <em>maxgap</em> positions are always
      separated into distinct matches, and</li>
      <li>report matches with <i>E</i>-values less than
      <em>threshold</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      The three parameters <em><i>p-</i>value threshold</em>,
      <em>maxgap</em> and <em>threshold</em> are described in more detail
      under "Options:", below.
      </p>

      <p>In log-odds score mode, the search can be thought of as
      consisting of two steps:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>find local matches between the model and each sequence that
      maximize the log-odds score and exceed <em>minscore</em>, and</li>
      <li>report matches with <i>E</i>-values less than
      <em>threshold</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      The <em>threshold</em> parameter is described in more detail under
      "Options:", below.
      </p>
      <p>In order for <i>E</i>-values to be computed by
      <code>mhmmscan</code>, at least 100 matches must be found. If there
      are too few sequences in the database, or if certain other options
      are made to stringent (see Options, below), too few matches may
      exist for <i>E</i>-values to be computed. In this case, the results
      are sorted by match score, the <i>E</i>-value column is set to
      "NaN" and all matches are printed.</p>

              <i>p</i>-value score mode, motif match scores are converted to
              their <i>p</i>-values. They are then converted to bit scores as follows:
              <div class="indent" style="font-family:monospace">
                S = -log<sub>2</sub>(p/T)
              </div>
              where <code>S</code> is the bit score of the hit, <code>p</code>
              is the <i>p</i>-value of the log-odds score, and T is the
              <i>p</i>-value threshold. In this way, only hits more significant
              than the <i>p</i>-value threshold get positive scores. The
              <i>p</i>-value threshold, <i>T</i>, must be in the range
              <i>0 &lt; T &le; 1</i>. This mode of scoring automatically activates
              the <span class="popt">-motif-scoring</span> feature (described
              below under "Advanced Options:") so that partial motif hits are
              disallowed.
              <h4>Note</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>If <i>p</i>-value threshold is too small, there may be few
                (or no) "hits", and, consequently, few (or no) matches. This
                may cause mhmmscan to be unable to compute match
                <i>E</i>-values, or to report no matches. Small values of the
                <i>p</i>-value threshold may also cause the reported
                <i>E</i>-values to be inaccurate. In this case, the
                <i>E</i>-values will always be too large (conservative). The
                proper value for the <i>p</i>-value threshold can only be
                determined by experimentation since it depends on the number
                of motifs, the information content of the motifs and the
                value of maxgap.</li>
                <li>If <i>p</i>-value threshold is too large, the expected
                length of a match may be longer than most of the sequences in
                the database you are searching. This will prevent mhmmscan
                from being able to compute <i>E</i>-values. Very low values
                of <i>p</i>-value threshold, when search genomic DNA, tend to
                give high scores to low-complexity sequence and repeated
                elements.</li>

              <span class="pdat">max gap</span> will be split into two
              separate matches. This switch automatically activates the
              <span class="popt">--zselo</span> option (described in the
              Advanced Options) so that gap emission scores are set to zero.
              It also sets the <span class="popt">--min-score</span> threshold
              to a small number (1e<sup>-6</sup>), and sets
